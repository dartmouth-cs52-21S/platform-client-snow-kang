# Lab 4 

*compli-pet*

## What Worked Well
- I really am happy with my overall design this time! I spent a lot of time adjusting the style to make it feel more clean than my previous labs which were always super busy (I still snuck a rainbow gradient into this lab though, I couldn't resist). 
-I learned a lot of new things like filtering, page transitions, and toast notifications! Yayyy 

## What Didn't
- I don't like that it sometimes shows previous posts before loading the current post; sometimes it runs smoothly and sometimes it shudders before settling in place. I'm planning on going to an office hours before the next lab to hopefully sort it out. I also got confused while adding the check for valid image urls. Not sure if I did that correctly.

## Extra Credit
- Not a blog; a pet appreciation page ! <3
- Fallback pictures in both the main screen as well as in the inner edit screen 
    - In the main screen, when the url is broken it shows a fallback silhouette of the animal or if no tag exists for it, an amiguous creature silhouette
    - In the edit screen, when the url is broken it changes a speech bubble above the animal icon to ask the user to reset the url - this gave me a lot of issues and I don't think I did it in the most React-friendly way; pointers here would be really appreciated D:
- Learned page animations using react-router-transition
- Used toast notifications to notify user when any field was left unfilled - I also remove these notifications upon changing pages 
- Used react-modal for a fun display that shows up when you try to delete a post
- Filter by tag (animal type!) 
- Lots of animations and effects everywhere
